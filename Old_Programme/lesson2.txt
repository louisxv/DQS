Definition of probability:
Given an experiment with a sample space S of equally likely outcomes and an event E (being a subset of
these outcomes, i.e. E .U S), the probability of E occurring is: P(E) = E/S 
-
Example: Coin flip
What is the probability of getting heads in a coin flip?
P(Heads)=1/ = because there is one heads side
 2= because there are 2 possible outcomes
-
Definition of sample space:
A set of all possible outcomes in an experiment

Combining experiments
There are rules to follow if we want to know the probability of two events occurring on two separate
events
Example: What is the chance of 2 heads in a row?
P(Heads and Heads) = .F1/2 * .F1/2 = .F1/4
As this has a specific condition a head and a head, we use the product rule which involves multiplying
the two probabilities
-
Further Example:
If there isn't a specific condition on the experiment we use the sum rule where we sum the probabilities
together eg
What is the chance of getting a heart card or a spade when drawing from a deck of cards?
P(Heart) = .F1/2   P(Spade)= .F1/4
P(Heart or Spade) = .F1/4 + .F1/4 = .F2/8 or .F1/2
-
Further examples:
What is the chance of getting a head in a coin flip and a heart card?
P(Heads) = .F1/2  P(Heart) = .F1/4
P(Heads and Heart) = .F1/2 * .F1/4 = .F1/8
-
Reverse probability
As probabilities must add to one so if we know the probability of an event we also know the probability
of the event not occurring.
Example:
The probability of drawing a spade card in a deck of cards is Â¼ so the probability of not getting a spade
card is .F3/4
P(Spade) = .F1/4  P(Not a spade) = 1 - .F1/4 = .F3/4
