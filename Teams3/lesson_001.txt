What is HTML?
-------------

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it is usually used for
describing web documents or web pages. HTML is a type of markup

HTML Tags
---------

HTML documents are comprised of tags, HTML tags are keywords,
they're basically names which are surrounded by ankle brackets.
HTML tags normally come in pairs where the first tag is the
opening tag and the second tag is the closing tag which includes a slash.
 

Elements
--------

Elements are what can be used in addition with the HTML tags
themselves to make the content more organised, some elements
include <p>, which is a an element that represents a paragraph,
<h1> - <h6>, which displays the headings of the content in
various levels e.g. <h1> being the biggest font and <h6>
being the smallest font. <table> can also be element which
represents a table in HTML, similar to this a form can be
implemented into HTML with the use of the <form> element,
These are called block elements. There are also other
elements to used which are called inline descriptive
elements, these elements are used to style the tags
content, some of these elements include <strong> which bolds
the text and gives a greater emphasis, <em> which renders
the text with italics and <cite> which causes citation
(source of information).

Common Image File Formats
-------------------------

There are four main image file formats that HTML
can understand and use. These are as follows: GIF
which is a lossless format for image files that
supports both animated and static images, usually
shown as .gif, PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
which is a raster graphics file format that
supports lossless data compression. JPEG
(Joint Photographic Experts Group) which is a
format for compressing image files, this is the
most common image format. The final format is SVG
(Scalable Vector Graphics) which is an XML-based
vector image format for two-dimensional graphics
with support for interactivity and animation.

HTML tables
-----------

HTML tables provide a way to access your data 
through an organised manner. HTML Tables consists
of Rows and Columns which are specified as cells, 
hese cells can contain any form of data including
text and images. The elements for tables within
HTML include: <table> which is the main element,
<tr> which represents the table rows, <th> which
represents the table header and <td> which is the
data that the table will contain.
