Definitions:
A .Bpermutation of a set of objects is an order of the objects in sequence
An .Br-permutation of a set of n elements is an ordered selection of r elements taken from the set without
repetition
An .Br-combination of a set of size n is a subset of size r

The Product Rule
If an operation consists of k steps where:
- 1 .SPst step can be enacted in n ways
- 2 .SPnd step can be enacted in n .SB2 ways (regardless of how the 1 .SPst step was enacted)
- ...
- .In .SPth step can be enacted in nk ways (regardless of how preceding steps were enacted)
This means that the entirety of the operation can be enacted in;
.In .SB1 x .In .SB2 x ... x .In k ways
-
Permutations
An example of a permutation:
S = {a, b, c} this set can then be reordered as;
abc acb bac bca cab cba
meaning that it has 6 permutations
-
Counting Permutations
An example of this is:
Set A of n objects has
.In! = .In x ( .In - 1 ) x ( .In - 2 ) x ... x 1 permutations
Why n-1?
Because for the 1 .SPst element .IP .SB1 there are n choices from A
Meaning that for the 2nd element .IP .SB2 there are .In - 1 choices from A
And so on, until there is 1 choice for the last element
(P(n, r)) - The number of r-permutations of a set of n elements is given by: 
P(n,r) = .Fn!/(n-r) Or .SPn .BP .SBr
-
Rule of Sums
If { S .SB1 , S .SB2, ... , S k } is a partition of a finite set S, then:
| S | = | S .SB1 | + |S .SB2 | + ... + | S k |
None of the partitions are empty, and they are all disjoint meaning there entirety makes S
-
For example:
S = {1, 2, 3, 4}
S .SB1 = {1}
S .SB2 = {2, 3, 4}
|S| = |S .SB1 | + |S .SB2 | = 1 + 3 = 4
This is generally used to divide a large problem into smaller sub-problems
-
(C(n, r)) â€“ This denotes the number of r-combinations of a set of size n:
C(n,r) = .Fn!/r!(n-r) Or .SPn .BC .SBr
Both .SPn P .SBr and .SPn C .SBr can be typed into a calculator to work out
